Algorithm-Pair-Best2 - 'best score' pairing algorithm
====================

This is a re-write of Algorithm::Pair::Best.  The interface is
simplified and the implementation is significantly streamlined.

Algorithm::Pair::Best2 provides a 'best score' pairing algorithm (for
go tournaments, for example).  Every possible pair gets a 'score' (or
perhaps 'penalty' is a better way to think about it) via a user
defined subroutine, and Algorithm::Pair::Best tries all possible
combinations of pairs to return the pairings with the best total score
(lowest penalty).
